= MessageDemo

A simple message-handling demo showing the UI thread onClickListener() sending a Message
to the background thread, telling it what operation to perform.

For more details, see Chapter 4 of the book Efficient Android Threading
by Anders Goransson, O'Reilly.

Some uses of Handler() are now deprecated in favor of just using a standard Java threadpool.
