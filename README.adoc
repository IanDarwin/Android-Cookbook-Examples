== Android Cookbook Examples

This repo is among the largest collections of Android code samples anywhere; it contains
around a hundred and fifty compilable source code examples from 
http://androidcookbook.com/[the O'Reilly Android Cookbook], a great source 
of tutorial material for the Android Developer. Not all recipes in the book or online have code
accompanying them; this repo features code that was either linked by the
contributor, or in some cases, re-constructed as a New Project by the
editor for your convenience.

Further note that not all programs used in the book/online appear here; some
of the examples in the book/online are only program fragments taken from
other programs that can't be included. And of course some code is drawn from existing projects
that are hosted elsewhere.

Each Directory comprises its own project, and has a name that is cited at the end of the corresponding Recipe, under the "Source Code Download" section. 

Some older started-in-Eclipse projects also have configuration files to allow them to be opened in Android Studio.
During the runup to the second edition of the book, AndMore appeared to be a viable project
to maintain Android Eclipse development.
However, it has become clear that AndMore has not attracted enough developer talent to remain viable.
Accordingly, the newest projects here are Android-Studio-Only.
And _Issue #1 calls for moving the existing mass of projects to Studio-only format_.
For reference, a "canonical" project would look something like this:

The table <<table>> lists each project, its author, and a short summary.

*Note that, since Gradle and the Gradle Android Plugin need to be updated 
just about every time your run Android Studio, there is no attempt made
to keep things up-to-date here; just let Studio do its upgrade thing for you
and all will be well. They promise.

=== DELETED PROJECTS

JpsTrack and the ToDo applications have graduated to their own github projects, under
https://github.com/IanDarwin[].

DuellingIDEs has been removed since the duel is over. Just use Android Studio.

=== List of Projects

The following list is generated (periodically) from the project folders.
In the _Builds With_ column, *E* for Eclipse, *M* for Maven, *S* for Android Studio, *G* for Gradle.
The Author names have recently been added; if I have missed or mis-attributed any, please
let me know and I will happily correct them. You (and I) know who you are.
