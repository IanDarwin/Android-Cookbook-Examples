= AIDLDemo

This project creates two APKs, the client and server, which are to be run
with different UIDs to demonstrate AIDL-based inter-*process* communication.

The AIDL itself is in the `lib` module, which both client and server modules depend on.

== STATUS

Client sends an Expense to Server. Server activity displays the list, (but only
after you rotate the device - some synchony failure).
