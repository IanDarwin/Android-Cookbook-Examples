= AIDLDemo

This project creates two APKs, the client and server, which run
with different UIDs to demonstrate AIDL-based inter-*process* communication.

The `lib` module is depended on by both client and server.
It exports the AIDL itself (and its generated artifacts),
and also the common data classes (e.g., Expense).
