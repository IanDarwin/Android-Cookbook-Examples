= AIDLDemo

This project creates two APKs, the client and server, which are to be run
with different UIDs to demonstrate AIDL-based inter-*process* communication.

The AIDL itself is in the `lib` module, which both client and server modules depend on.

== STATUS

Client sends an Expense to Server. Need to expand server activity to display a list, say.
