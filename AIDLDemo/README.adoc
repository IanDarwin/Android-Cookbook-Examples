= AIDLDemo: A Remote Bound Android Service with two apps, bindService, and local broadcast

This project creates two APKs, the client and server, which run
with different UIDs to demonstrate AIDL-based inter-*process* communication.

There is no rational reason for having the expenses created in one app and
displayed in another, except that it makes a good demonstration of AIDL.

The `lib` module is depended on by both client and server.
It exports the AIDL itself (and its generated artifacts),
and also the common data class (e.g., Expense).
