    | IMPORTANT !                                                                                                      |
    | Every single one of the property names has been changed to be a little more unified. The new format is now       |
    | "chart.xxx" where xxx is the actual name. Some of the names have been changed completely, eg. "chart.text.size", |
    | which was formerly "textheight", whilst others only marginally. This was necessary to bring some semblance of    |
    | uniformity to the RGraph properties across all of the libraries, make it look a bit more "proffessional" and     |
    | provide plenty of scope for future properties.                                                                   |
    |                                                                                                                  |
    | You should also note that as of this release (14th March 2009) that RGraph has been changed to use the canvas    |
    | text and shadow APIs. This may mean you needing to upgrade your browser if you want to use the latest version.   |
    | At the time of writing, this meant Firefox 3.1b2, Safari 4 and Chrome 2. If you don't wish to upgrade your       |
    | browser, or need Opera support, then you will need to remain on the 28th February 2009 version.                  |

           | charts in a fundamental way. For the better. Any update should be done cautiously. But since        |
           | RGraph is beta, all updates should be done that way. Judging by the RGraph test page though,        |
           | everything seems fine.                                                                              |
