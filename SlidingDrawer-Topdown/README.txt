The main code is from the "Sliding Drawer - Top Down" recipe contributed by Wagied Davids
to the Android Cookbook. The Panel and easing/*Interpolator stuff was taken from a
different project on Wagied's web site, TestSlidingDrawer.

Some of the graphic elements were taken from the http://smart-timetable.googlecode.com/
"Smart Timetable" googlecode project, and are copyright, and ASL-2 licensed, by Google Inc.
